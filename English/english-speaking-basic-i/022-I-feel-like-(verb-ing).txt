I feel like + (verb-ing)
Listen to the Entire Lesson

Here you are expressing to someone something you would enjoy doing.

Here are some examples:

"I feel like going for a bike ride."
"I feel like going to the beach."
"I feel like having a snack."
"I feel like talking."
"I feel like dancing."
"I feel like having friends over to my house."
"I feel like watching TV."

By adding 'don't' or 'do not' you can change what you are saying to express something you would not enjoy or express a concern about something.

Here are some examples:

"I don't feel like leaving yet."
"I don't feel like explaining."
"I don't feel like going to bed."
"I do not feel comfortable talking about it."
"I do not feel like we are going in the right direction."
