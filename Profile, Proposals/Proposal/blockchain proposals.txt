Portfolio

OPEN PET WORLD
This is Crypto Game site for P2E.
Features are as follow: Collection, Keeping Pet, Building Village, Sweet Home.
It includes Defi, NFT Marketplace, Tokenomics, NFT collection.
In this site, users can earn money while playing.

Cardahub
This is NFT marketplace for Cardano Network.
It includes NFT marketplace, collection, minting page.

Normally, eCommerce website needs SEO(Search Engine Optimization) and then Next.js supports SEO easily.
But Next.js don't interacts with external vanilla css, so the speed of landing page is low.
So I solved the speed problem using spinner and replacing images and interacting problem using global css inside next,js.
