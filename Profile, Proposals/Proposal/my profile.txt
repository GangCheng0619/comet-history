I have good experience in developing websites and application for 9+ years.
I have built the business websites as CRM, CMS, real estate, course, stock, sales and so on using PHP and React.JS.
I love to think about myself as a perfectionist: in my opinion, at the base of a solid product, there must be concepts like scalability, security, maintainability and a perfect UI/UX design, but all of them need to receive the right priority to make sure an MVP oriented development process could be followed.
I have mobile app development technology while working so integrated 3rd party libraries as 3D, Firebase, Recognition and completed mobile app and deployed.
Also I have worked on some projects with companies.
