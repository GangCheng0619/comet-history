Combined with my B.Sc. in Systems Engineering, those years have allowed me to build skills as a full-stack developer, specializing in writing smart contracts for DeFis and dApps as well as full stack web development through the use of PHP and JavaScript frameworks (especially blockchain-based applications).

I have checked your site and I agree all of your requirements.
I am well-versed in the following programming languages:
- Cryptocurrency tech:

* Crypto Coins Exchange Development
* Custom Blockchain Development
* ICO Development with Created Token ( Coin )
* Smart-Contracts (Solidity, Truffle framework)
* Token development (ERC20, ERC223, ERC721, ERC 1155)
* Cryptocurrency Wallet and Exchange Applications
* Private Blockchain Development

- Web tech:

* Javascript, Node/Express, React, Vue, Web3js
* Laravel, CodeIgniter, Yii
* React, Vue, Angular, Node/Express
* WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Joomla
* Chrome extension, Automation script
* Python, Flask, Django, Webscraper
* MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, MySQL
I never back down from a project and can handle any setup or framework specifications you may need.

Thanks for taking the time to read through my profile, and I hope to speak with you soon!



I use several frameworks, but I usually use Javascript frameworks or libraries such as React.js, Node.js, ExpressJS, Nest.js, Angular etc.
Also, I use PHP frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgnitor, Drupal, zend etc and CMS such as wordpress.

********************** Casino Game

Hi dear client.

I have reviewed your project description and I think you need blockchain and also frontend dev for your casino game.
note: I hope you to share if which kind of casino do you need exactly.

in my experience in casino field, I have done Roulette, Poker and Blackjack before.
as concerned as logic of blockchain casino game;
- players need to own our game token to play game, means they must deposit game token to start game.
- it can be multiplayer or single user game maybe. (it depends on your mind)
in case of single user, a plyer will play with AI.
- there are some progress such as bet, hold, all-in and etc..
then finally, they will get/lose tokens according to if win/fail.

what I need to do for this project are;
- solid frontend.
- game with implementation with proper logic.
- write smart contract in solidity.
- integrating smart contract and game.

Unlike with some other developers, I create, just not copy & paste.
