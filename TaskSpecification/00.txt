1) Buyers will pay sellers using escrow with bitcoin or monero
2) Buyers and sellers will pay a % for the escrow transaction
3) Users will pay a one time fee if they want to be a seller
4) I want to make sure that we do not hold users money, for security
we want to protect everybody. However you know better and I will take 
your advice.

Thank You
